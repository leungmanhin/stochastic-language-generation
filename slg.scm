  slg . SEEDS

  Start the stochastic language generation.

  One or more words can be passed to the function as SEEDS,
  the sentence being generated will grow from the SEEDS.

  SEEDS can either be atoms (WordNode/WordClassNode), or
  strings, but not a mix of both. If strings are passed,
  they will all be treated as words. Categories, aka
  word classes, can only be passed as atoms (WordClassNode).

  The order of the SEEDS being passed will be perserved
  in the sentence being generated, based on the current
  implementation.

  The generation will start from left (LEFT-WALL) to right
  if no word has been passed as SEEDS.

  slg-replace SENTENCE [LG-DICT]

  Replace one or more words in SENTENCE with other words that
  belong to the same linguistic categories.

  It's assumed that words with the same link at the same position (left/right)
  are in the same category. For example:

    +-Ss*b+      +-Ss*b+
    |     |      |     |
    this is      that is

  \"this\" and \"that\" are assumed to be in the same category, so a sentence
  like \"this is a cat\" may be transformed into \"that is a cat\".

  An optional argument LG-DICT can be passed to indicate what Link Grammar
  dictionary will be used by the Link Parser for parsing this sentence. The
  default dictionary is \"en\".

  If a custom LG dictionary is passed, it's assumed that the dictionary is
  placed under \"/usr/local/share/link-grammar\", with all the other required
  files (like those 4.0.*) in place already.
